# Darktide Vortex Extension

## Installation

**Download the extension directly from Nexus Mods: https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/684**

### Manually
1. Download [game-warhammer40kdarktide.zip](https://github.com/danreeves/vortex-extension-darktide/releases/latest)
2. In Vortex go to the Extensions tab
3. Either drag the zip into the "Drop file(s)" area or click it to browse for the zip
4. Searching the extensions page for "darktide" should now show "Game: Warhamme 40,000: Darktide" installed and enabled

## Getting Started

1. Go to the Games tab and search for "darktide"
2. Hover the game and click Manage
3. Two new tabs will appear on the right hand side: "Mods" and "Load Order"

### Mods

In the Mods tab you can manage which mods are installed. Drop mods here and press "Deploy Mods". Mods must be "deployed" to the game folders before they will appear in the Load Order.

### Load Order

In the Load order tab you can control **which are enabled in game** and in **which order they are loaded**. Load order is only important when mods depend on each other or they override each others behaviour. Last mod loaded wins.

### Tools

The modding tools come with a patcher which modifies the game to load mods. From the Vortex Dashboard you can run this tool to patch or unpatch the game. This will need to be done after each patch.

## FAQs

#### Why aren't mods loading?

Ensure you have patched the game, and you have mods both "deployed" and enabled in the load order.
